```yaml
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket

```
Replace `your_api_key`, `your_auth_domain`, and other placeholders with your actual Firebase configuration values. If you don't have a Firebase project yet, you can create one by following the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

3. Install the project dependencies using the following command: `npm install`
4. Build the project using: `npm run build`
5. Start the project using: `npm start`

The application should now be running locally on your machine.

Note: Make sure you have set up a Firebase project and obtained the necessary configuration values before proceeding.
